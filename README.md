## SimpleCNN
This code implements a simple CNN for hand-written digit classification
## Image Classification
- Train an image classification model on CIFAR dataset with ResNet-18.
-  Use different data augmentation techniques and different ways to avoid overfitting.
- Use class activation map to analyze the feature maps of the classification model.
- Train an image classification model on CIFAR dataset with Vision Transformers (ViT).
