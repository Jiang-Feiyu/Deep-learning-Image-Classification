# Deep-learning-Image-Classification.
This is a simple CNN traing model for hand writing digits classification/ Assignment 2 and Project of HKU ELEC4542
## Assignment 2: SimpleCNN
This code implements a simple CNN for hand-written digit classification
### Image Classification
- Train an image classification model on CIFAR dataset with ResNet-18.
-  Use different data augmentation techniques and different ways to avoid overfitting.
- Use class activation map to analyze the feature maps of the classification model.
- Train an image classification model on CIFAR dataset with Vision Transformers (ViT).
## Project: Image Classification
#### Train an image classification model on CIFAR dataset with ResNet-18. Report the classification accuracy on the test set.
- For this project, I use the CIFAR10 dataset. It consists of 60000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. ResNet-18 is a convolutional neural network that is 18 layers deep.
#### Use different data augmentation techniques and different ways to avoid overfitting. Report the classification accuracy on the test set with different types of data augmentations.
- Data Augmentation is simply creating variations of training data to increases its size at the same time regularizes the network. Some common data augmentation techniques in image classification include
    - Random Flips and Rotations
    - Random Crop and Center Crop
    - Normalizing the image
    - ...
- The choice of data augmentation techniques depends on the specific characteristics of the dataset and the problem at hand. Itâ€™s often beneficial to experiment with different combinations of augmentation techniques to find the ones that work best.
#### Visualize the class activation maps of the trained models.
